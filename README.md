# Deep-learning-based acceleration of MRI for radiotherapy planning of pediatric patients with brain tumors

DeepMRIRec is a deep learning based pipeline for RT-coil specific MRI reconstruction. DeepMRIRec accelarate MRI acquisition by 4 times and produce sharp and trustworthy images to meet demands of mission critical applications. The details of the methods can be found in our manuscript. If you want to use our methods please follow the steps from "scripts/DeepMRIRec" jupyter notebook.
